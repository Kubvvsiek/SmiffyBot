## About Project
- Smiffy is a Polish discord bot that was originally intended for a single server.
However, we are where we are and it is currently on over 1600 servers.


- I recently decided that I will make the project public for everyone, because I think it is quite a good project and unfortunately, but lately I do not have much time for it any more - Perhaps there will be a person who will be able to help me improve the bot.


<!-- + ## ~~Nextcord Library~~ (It's currently outdated)
- Bot is based mainly on nextcord (a fork of Discord.py), but much of the code has been removed or changed just for the bot. For example, the entire implementation of prefix commands or even entire objects such as `Context` have been removed.


- Cache system has also been lightly changed, so methods that make HTTP requests `(.fetch)` after receiving a response will automatically add the object to the cache.


- You can see the edited version of nextcord at this [link](https://github.com/SmiffyBot/nextcord/tree/Smiffy).

## Contributing
- Everyone can become a bot developer. I just expect a decent knowledge of the Python language, as well as the ability to develop bots, to learn more, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
